asset-part file(for multi-part assets)
the key here is both the asset-number/part-number combination
only 99 parts for any asset should be satisfactory.
this file will be a current condition file for all assets and
their individual parts. the maintenance file will auto-update
when any maintenance is done on the assets and their parts

[i am assuming that all 
 initial condition values have been loaded
 taken from the asset management excel files]
  
opening day scenio #1:

a pipe has broken the previous night.

the operator visits the site, diagnoses the problem
and calls for a repair order for authorization to
fix the problem.

remote access to the office computer allows the USER
to create a new repair-replace-maintenance-file record.
to do this the USER MUST know the asset number of the
pipe in question. this is done using the 911 address in
the asset file that is closest to the break.

(the asset number for the pipes will be pre-loaded with
 the nearest 911 adress for the location. it is
 true that a complete 911 adress may have two or more pipe
 segments assigned to it, only because it is probably
 impossible to get an gps location for each seqment of pipe .)
 
if  the exact pipe is not known a quess is allowed; 
but MUST be changed to the exact asset when determined
by the operator. 

the px-action code is a  0 until authorization is granted
 by the user, not the operator)
 
 when authorization is granted for work the two date values
 and the two costs will be entered, the part cost should come
 from the preloaded part cost from the asset-part file.
 the esimate cost will be an estimate from an  operarator/user
discusion.  

the labor cost will be entered when an invoice is approved by the
board. until then the cost will be zero.

this form will be printed and/or sent to the operator via e-mail.

this method will obviate the need for a separate purchase order
file.

the px-cond , px-redun , and px-conseq  value get loaded from
the asset-part file automatically. the px-cond value will be
affected when a replacement is warranted. the px-redun and px-conseq
value don't change. the sb-date field for each part replaced must
be modified with the repair date.
 all changes made must be made in the asset-part.
file automatically, in order to maintain the asset-part file in acurrent
status mode. (this allows for reading the asset-part file to get
current-conditions-of-the-complete-system reports.)
 

the description field is completed by the operator 
to describe the process, denoting any "special" complications
that seem important for future reference.
