we are running ACCUCOBOL on a linux box.
one file is 1.2m records with 1 alternate key with duplicates.

one of the duplicate keys has 48K entries
when read along this keypath the accucobol performs in 13 secs.


one our other linux box the keypath takes 15mins.!

the alternate key was created using db_load and the input file
was sorted in alternate key order, and sub-sorted by the primary key.

that load took less than 30 secs.


what am i missing in db isam file construction that can inprove
performance when reading along the alternate record key path?

or is 48k too big for efficiency?
