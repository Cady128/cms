mediation scenio 

I. arguments to use to continue with the present contract.

1. memorandum of understanding issued to fd1 by fd3.
   wherein fd3 wants each user to be paying the same rate.
   .. fd3 users are  paying a much lower rate than fd1 users.   

2. the contract in place is being interpreted incorrectly.
   .. the contracts says explicitly fd3 pays fd1 the budgeted
      items at the percentage elicited in the contract.
      the contract says the fd3 should be charged at a rate
      per thousand. taking the budgeted amount for 2018
      and dividing by the gallons metered to fd3 in 2017 that
      rate is around $3.50 /1,000. 
      the definition of the word pumped in the contract is
      being mis-interpreted. it means pumped to fd3; not
      pumped to our resevoir! to mean otherwise is to negate
      the concept of equal rates for fd1 and fd3. even that
      does not guarantee equal rates; only depreciation
      methology does; or absorbing fd3 into fd1!     

      
      
II. arguments for renegotiating a new contract.

1 get sworn testimony that the contract was negotiable from the
   day it was signed.   
   
2 define the present geography of fd3.
   .. expansion of fd3 puts presure on the fd1 aquafer
      
3 selling fd3 water to non-fd3  clients.
   .. this also puts pressure on the fd1 aquafer
   
3 fd1 must have control over items 1. and 2 to be
   responsible to fd1 clients.

5. redesign the contract based on a depreciation of assets
   methods rather than the percentage method used in the present
   contract. simply put,  fd3 would pay fd1 a percentage of the 
   depreciation of all assets of fd1 used to pumped water to fd3.
   that percentage would be calculated using only the total metered
   water and what fd1 actually pumped to fd3. that percentage
   would be fd3 metered / total metered. as an example, a pipe
   whose depreciated yearly value is $1,000 and if fd3 used 35% of
   all metered water, then the pipes cost of use to fd3 would be
   $350.00. 
   the reasoning behind depreciation methology is to plan for expected
   cost of repair/replace when doing budgeting; for which depreciation
   is the best way to do this. 
   
   


   
III. failure to renegoiate a new contract. 

1. plan the sue fd3 for failure to comply to the present
   contract as described in I.

2. notify fd3 that fd1 no longer wants fd3 to be its client.


IV. a letter to fd3 from our attourney that states fd1
    will not settle for less that the $3.50 / 1,000 rate
    immediately. and that a renegotiated contract will be
    including the ideas put forth in II above.
